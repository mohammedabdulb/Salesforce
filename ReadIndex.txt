LWCToFlow:- This LWC Component Contain changes related to showing combo box means picklist dropdown via html after calling apex class.
**UseCase** :- 
Also this LWC was embeded in the flow and getting record id from the flow then returning apex data to the lwc component on load.
This component read inputs from the flow and send data also to the flow but this data wont be shown on same screen because screens are not reactive.
LWC data retruning to the flow can be shown by adding second screen.
Issue faced :- Showing picklist drowpdown , fixed this issue by using below line of codes.
           var optionList = [];
            result.forEach(element => {
                    const option = {
                        label: element,
                        value: element
                    };
                optionList.push(option);
            });
            this.options = optionList; // (Note :- this.options is the input parament which was defined in the js at top.
            console.log('~~~this.options ~~~~',this.options);
